Hello! 

* The main file that calculates the magnetizations is named: magnetizacoes.py
* To calculate half-integer spins, just enter the value of the numerator. Example: for spin 3/2, I will just type 3.

# Parameters:
# m_i - Magnetiation per particle unit of sublattice i
# D_i - Anisotropy of subnet i
# gamma_i - Variational parameter of subnet i
# beta - 1 / Kb*T, where Kb is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature
